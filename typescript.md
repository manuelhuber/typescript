# Typescript

TypeScript (TS) is a superset of JavaScript (JS). 
It's main improvments are static typing and type interference which allow for more code/error analysis during development.  
The TS code you write will be compiled to JS and then be executed e.g. in a browser. All valid JS is also valid TS - the compiler will simply output the JS you put in. When compiling to a newer Version of JS there are more features available but not all runtime environments will support it. To increase compatibility most TS and JS code is currently compiled to the previous version, since the new "ES6" (also called "ECMAScript 2015") standard isn't implemented fully in all common browsers.
