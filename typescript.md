# Typescript

TypeScript (TS) is a superset of JavaScript (JS). 
It offers static typing, type interference  
The TS code you write will be compiled to JS and then be executed e.g. in a browser. All valid JS is also valid TS - the compiler will simply output the JS you put in. When compiling to a newer Version of JS there are more features available (e.g. ES 6 and Maps) but not all runtime environments will support it.
